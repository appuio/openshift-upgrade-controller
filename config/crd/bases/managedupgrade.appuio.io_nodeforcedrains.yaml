                description: |-
                  NodeDrainGracePeriod is the duration until the controller starts to delete pods on the node.
                  The duration is calculated from the OpenShist node drain annotation.
                  This circumvents the eviction API and means that PDBs are ignored.
                  This is not a force delete, but it will delete pods that are not managed by a controller.
                  A zero value disables the force drain.

                  A nil selector matches no nodes, while an empty selector matches all nodes.

                        A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that

                            the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                            the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                            merge patch.

                  PodForceDeleteGracePeriod is the duration until the controller starts to force delete pods on the node.
                  The duration is calculated from the pods deletion timestamp.
                  This is equivalent to the `--force --grace-period=0` flag of `kubectl delete pod`.
                  A zero value disables the force delete.
