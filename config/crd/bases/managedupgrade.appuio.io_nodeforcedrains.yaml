                description: |-
                  NodeDrainGracePeriod is the duration until the controller starts to delete pods on the node.
                  The duration is calculated from the OpenShist node drain annotation.
                  This circumvents the eviction API and means that PDBs are ignored.
                  This is not a force delete, but it will delete pods that are not managed by a controller.
                  A zero value disables the force drain.

                            the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                            merge patch.

                description: |-
                  PodForceDeleteGracePeriod is the duration until the controller starts to force delete pods on the node.
                  The duration is calculated from the pods deletion timestamp.
                  Only pods on nodes that have reached the nodeDrainGracePeriod are force deleted.
                  The maximum time until pod force deletion is nodeDrainGracePeriod+podForceDeleteGracePeriod.
                  The deletion done is equivalent to the `--now` or the `--grace-period=1` flag of `kubectl delete pod`.
                  We do not use `--force --grace-period=0`, if doing so the pod would be dropped from the API without being killed on the node.
                  Such pods do block the reboot of the node and the node will stay in a `NotReady` state for extended periods.
                  A zero value disables the force delete.
