                  Overlays are the overlays applied to the base ClusterVersion object at the time specified in the From field.
                  Overlays do not combine, the overlay with the latest From timestamp is applied.
                  If two overlays have the same From timestamp, the behavior is undefined.
                  Overlays can't remove fields from the base ClusterVersion object.
                  You can work around this by setting the field to an empty value in the base ClusterVersion and applying an overlay in the past with the field set;
                  this allows the next overlay to remove the field.

                                The CVO will check the release signatures in the local ConfigMaps first. It will search for a valid signature
                                in these stores in parallel only when local ConfigMaps did not include a valid signature.
                                Validation will fail if none of the signature stores reply with valid signature before timeout.
                                Setting signatureStores will replace the default signature stores with custom signature stores.
                                Default stores can be used with custom signature stores by adding them manually.

                                A maximum of 32 signature stores may be configured.

                      By default, CVO will use existing signature stores if this property is empty.
                      The CVO will check the release signatures in the local ConfigMaps first. It will search for a valid signature
                      in these stores in parallel only when local ConfigMaps did not include a valid signature.
                      Validation will fail if none of the signature stores reply with valid signature before timeout.
                      Setting signatureStores will replace the default signature stores with custom signature stores.
                      Default stores can be used with custom signature stores by adding them manually.

                      A maximum of 32 signature stores may be configured.

                                By default, CVO will use existing signature stores if this property is empty.
                                The CVO will check the release signatures in the local ConfigMaps first. It will search for a valid signature
                                in these stores in parallel only when local ConfigMaps did not include a valid signature.
                                Validation will fail if none of the signature stores reply with valid signature before timeout.
                                Setting signatureStores will replace the default signature stores with custom signature stores.
                                Default stores can be used with custom signature stores by adding them manually.

                                A maximum of 32 signature stores may be configured.

                                      The key "ca.crt" is used to locate the data.
