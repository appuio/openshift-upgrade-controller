                  Overlays are the overlays applied to the base ClusterVersion object at the time specified in the From field.
                  Overlays do not combine, the overlay with the latest From timestamp is applied.
                  If two overlays have the same From timestamp, the behavior is undefined.
                  Overlays can't remove fields from the base ClusterVersion object.
                  You can work around this by setting the field to an empty value in the base ClusterVersion and applying an overlay in the past with the field set;
                  this allows the next overlay to remove the field.

                                desiredUpdate is an optional field that indicates the desired value of
                                the cluster version. Setting this value will trigger an upgrade (if

                                recommended update values is listed as part of available updates in

                                rollbacks will succeed.
